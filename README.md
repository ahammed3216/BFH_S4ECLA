# Cosmo Gangs Event Portal
We have created an Event management portal for an astronomy club “Cosmo Gangs”. The  event portal is designed with an easy user interface were students can participate and give suggestions for the events of the club. The website gives provision for creating a personal account and the user can track their registered events and events attended. Students can give suggestions for new events by filling an event creation form which includes information such as Event title, date and time , maximum number of participants , event description and banner image. Once the event is verified and approved by the admin it will be automatically updated as a new event in the portal where all students can register for it. The event portal will ease the process of event management and the project is scalable
