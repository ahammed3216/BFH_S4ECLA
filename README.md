# Cosmo Gangs Event Portal
We have created an Event management portal for an astronomy club “Cosmo Gangs”. The  event portal is designed with an easy user interface were students can participate and give suggestions for the events of the club. The website gives provision for creating a personal account and the user can track their registered events and events attended. Students can give suggestions for new events by filling an event creation form which includes information such as Event title, date and time , maximum number of participants , event description and banner image. Once the event is verified and approved by the admin it will be automatically updated as a new event in the portal where all students can register for it. The event portal will ease the process of event management and the project is scalable

## How it Works ?
1. We have developed the website front end using HTML and CSS and all the backend process is done with Django. The user can use all the functionalities of the site after signing up. In the login page all upcoming event will be listed. User can click and navigate to each event and can see all the details about the event and he can also register for the event. In the profile page he can see all the registered event and he also can add new events by filling the create event form. Events are added once the admin approves it.  Admin can manage and edit all event activities
